We are given the following: NIF LDA AR OAOWCQ_HZ_WWZEBIQQGIL

gcc break_enigma.c enigma.c NBestList.c scoreText.c -lm -O3
./a.out
We get: THEKEYISENIUMAISFASCINATING
Obviously they spelled it wrong, they meant to say ENIGMA_IS_FASCINATING


We can also guess the flag:
The beginning looks like "THE KEY IS". Afterwards, we get a six character word which can be ENIGMA or TURING. Then a two character word which is most likely IS. The last one must be an adjective of 11 characters.

So, the flag ends up being: ENIGMA_IS_FASCINATING
