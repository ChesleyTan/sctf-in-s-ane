The important line is

`fgets(name,34,stdin);`

Before that, we can see that name is a buffer of 32 chars.

`char name[32];`

Which means overflowing time!!!

Dump a string of 32 random characters and then the 33rd will need to be a char where the ascii representation has a value of > 126
In this case, the tilda (~) has a value of 126.

Inputting 12345678901234567890123456789012~ as my name, I get authorization level to view the flag
